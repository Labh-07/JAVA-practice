        //64 : using foreach loop occurrence of element in array
        //65 : use break to input till user exit exit (here is String command; and is we check for command if(command=="exit" -> then it is not work because we can not compare object to string via == beacuse it comapre that both string are in same adress or not it means it checks the refrences) )
        //   solution 65 : if(command.equals("exit")){...}  or command.equalsIgnoreCase("exit"); in this case case are no matters
        //66 : all positive number sum and skip negative with using continue
        //67 : print even using continue
